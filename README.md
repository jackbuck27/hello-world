# hello-world
This is my first repository in Github. Hello World, Go Irish!

Hello everyone, I'm Jackson Buckley, a senior at Notre Dame studying Business Analytics. This is my first time using Github and I honestly am very interested in using it more. I'm assuming we will use this in Unstructured Data Analytics quite a bit.

This is very cool.
